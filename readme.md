# Present your work with Git and Rebase

## Exercise 10 - Separate formatting from more important stuff

Scenario:

- Your team is competing to see who can get the most rolling rick's on screen.
- But it's next to impossible to count them all.
- You add a rick counter and create a pull request: https://github.com/kraftlauget/git-ws-10/pull/1
- You get some feedback that you're now going to solve.

Instructions for exercise:

- Have a look at the pull request: https://github.com/kraftlauget/git-ws-10/pull/1 and the comment there.
- Checkout branch `start`.
- Create a new branch `exercise`.
- Have a look at the commits in `solution` branch.
- Split the "Add rick counter" commit into two commits:
  1. Formatting changes
  2. Add rick counter
- Check out the solution pull request: https://github.com/kraftlauget/git-ws-10/pull/2
  - Notice how "Add rick counter" is easier to review now.
  - It's also easier to review the formatting changes, expecting it not to contain any other types of changes.
